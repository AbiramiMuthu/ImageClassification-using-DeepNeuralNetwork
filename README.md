# ImageClassification-using-DeepNeuralNetwork
Digit recognition using CNN
The dataset is available inside torchvision library or we can download it from Kaggle
I have used DNN we can use any of the pretrained model also to train
Tried moving the code to GPU to reduce the processing time(try in google colab)
